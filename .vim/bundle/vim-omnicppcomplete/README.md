Installation
---
If you don't have a preferred installation method, I recommend
installing [pathogen.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), and
then simply copy and paste:

    cd ~/.vim/bundle
    git clone https://github.com/yandy/vim-omnicppcomplete.git
    
Anyway, you can still use normal installation method, extract the repo content into your ~/.vim
